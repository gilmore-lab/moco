## Purpose

1. Plan work for Infant MOCO poster for [ICIS 2018](https://infantstudies.org/congress-2018/) (due 12/1/2017).
    - Poster Submission
        - Include an abstract (max 3500 characters â€“ 500 words)
         - Prepare an abstract title (max 130 character limit)
2. Plan work for Infant MOCO manuscript for submission late 2017.

## Gathering

- Get data from Box
    - Currently 18 Participants on Box, there should be 24

## Cleaning & export

- Examine data
    + Data under projects > optic flow > optic flow eeg > moco > moco eeg lamrad infant > analysis > data > raw sessions
    - no data under csv or csv-thresh 200
- Clean and export from the `inf_2pat_lamrad_YYYMMDD` files.
    - These are "buried" or nested under a subject-id folder.
- Combine subject-ids with metadata from [Databrary](https://databrary.org/volume/146).
- Remove identifiers
- Save de-identified data
- Upload de-identified data to GitHub
    - Make sure data are in format similar to [GTF 2016 on GitHub](https://github.com/gilmore-lab/gilmore-thomas-fesi-2015), see especially the README [here](https://github.com/gilmore-lab/gilmore-thomas-fesi-2015/tree/master/csv)

## Visualization

- Summary of participant characteristics
    - Sex, age range, etc.
- Individual-level
    - T2Circ (like Gilmore, Thomas & Fesi, 2016; Figure 3)
    - Map of all electrodes (like Gilmore, Thomas & Fesi, 2016; Figure 4) for 1F1, 2F1, 3F1, 4F1
    - Plots of channels that meet threshold like (Figures 5 & 6)
    - N.B. -- The GTF 2016 paper had 3 speeds and 3 patterns, so our code will have to be changed for 2 speeds and 2 patterns.
- Group-level
    - T2Circ (like Gilmore, Thomas & Fesi, 2016; Figure 3)
    - Map of all electrodes (like Gilmore, Thomas & Fesi, 2016; Figure 4) for 1F1, 2F1, 3F1, 4F1
    - Plots of channels that meet threshold like (Figures 5 & 6)

## Analysis

- Hypothesis: Infants should show larger amplitude EEG to fast motion.

    - Sample [video](https://nyu.databrary.org/slot/11442/32561,42614/asset/38756/download?inline=true) of linear motion, 8 deg/s
    
    - Sample [video](https://nyu.databrary.org/slot/11442/10642,20695/asset/38752/download?inline=true) of radial motion, 8 deg/s
    

- Hypothesis: Infants should show larger amplitude EEG to linear motion.

## Write-up

* Confirm GTF 2016 references are in PaperPile
     + Enter missing into PaperPile [(**Completed**)](https://paperpile.com/app/label/96331605-5b62-0cd2-a201-73b1c6dd5a96)
    + Copy refs to [infant-moco-refs.md](https://github.com/gilmore-lab/moco/blob/master/infant-moco-refs.md) (**Completed**)
         - There is a reference from GTF2016 that is listed twice (#56 and #77)
* Sample displays are on Databrary: <https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/75>
* Draft methods section can be found [here](moco-inf-2pat-lamrad-manuscript2016.md).
